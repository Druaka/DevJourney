        This <b class="rainbowfx">MEAN stack</b> web app is made possible thanks to <b class="rainbowfx">free-tier</b>
        cloud hosting—services that let you run apps and databases online at no cost. It’s a simple way to learn, test,
        and launch your ideas.

    <h4>🛠️ Backend</h4>
    <p>
        Hosted on
        <app-link url="https://render.com" hexColor="#06b6d4">Render</app-link>
        (<b class="rainbowfx">free-tier</b>),
        which automatically redeploys the backend whenever changes are pushed to the
        <code class="surface-200 px-1 rounded">devjourney</code> Git repository's backend directory.
        <app-link url="https://render.com" hexColor="#06b6d4">Render</app-link>
        spins down the backend after 15 minutes of inactivity to conserve resources. When a new request comes in, the
        service spins back up—this can take up to a minute, causing a brief delay before the app responds. Powered by
        <span class="font-semibold">Node.js</span> and <span class="font-semibold">Express</span>, the backend exposes
        RESTful endpoints to serve Pokémon TCG data, fetched and processed using
        <span class="font-semibold">TCGdex</span> (a dedicated Pokémon TCG API). The server begins listening for
        requests only after the routes and database are successfully initialized.
    </p>
    <h4>🗄️ Database</h4>
    <p>
        Hosted on <span class="font-semibold rainbowfx">OVH MongoDB Discovery</span>. During backend startup, the server
        connects to the database.
        Once connected, it drops the existing database, fetches the latest Pokémon card sets via the TCGdex SDK,
        sanitizes the data, stores it in MongoDB,
        and caches it in memory for fast access.
