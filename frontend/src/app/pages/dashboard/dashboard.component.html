        This <b class="text-primary">MEAN stack</b> web app is made possible thanks to <b class="rainbowfx">free-tier</b>
        cloud hosting—services that let you run apps and databases online at no cost. It’s a simple way to learn, test,
        and launch your ideas.
    </p>
    <h4>🛠️ Backend</h4>
    <p>
        Hosted on
        <app-link url="https://render.com" hexColor="#06b6d4">Render’s</app-link>&nbsp;
        <b class="rainbowfx">free-tier</b>, the backend is automatically redeployed whenever changes are pushed to the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Druaka/devjourney">
            <code class="surface-200 px-1 rounded">devjourney</code>
        </a> repository’s backend directory. Due to the limitations of the <b class="rainbowfx">free-tier</b>, the
        service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request is made, it spins back up—this cold start
        can take up to a minute, introducing a short delay before the app responds. Built with
        <span class="font-semibold">Node.js</span> and <span class="font-semibold">Express</span>, the backend exposes
        RESTful endpoints to serve Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) data, fetched and processed using
        <span class="font-semibold">TCGdex</span>, an API dedicated to Pokémon TCG data. The server begins listening for
        requests only after the routes and database are successfully initialized.
    </p>
    <h4>🗄️ Database</h4>
    <p>
        Hosted on
        <app-link url="https://render.com" hexColor="#ec4899">OVH MongoDB Discovery</app-link>
        . During backend startup, the server connects to the database. Once connected, it drops the existing database,
        fetches the latest Pokémon card sets via the TCGdex SDK, sanitizes the data, stores it in MongoDB, and caches it
        in memory for fast access.
